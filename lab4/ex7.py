# The game of Nim. This is a well-known game with a number of variants. The following variant
# has an interesting winning strategy. Two players alternately take marbles from a pile. In each
# move, a player chooses how many marbles to take. The player must take at least one but at most
# half of the marbles. Then the other player takes a turn. The player who takes the last marble loses.
# Write a program in which the computer plays against a human opponent. Generate a random
# integer between 10 and 100 to denote the initial size of the pile. Generate a random integer
# between 0 and 1 to decide whether the computer or the human takes the first turn. Generate a
# random integer between 0 and 1 to decide whether the computer plays smart or stupid. In stupid
# mode the computer simply takes a random legal value (between 1 and n/2) from the pile whenever
# it has a turn. In smart mode the computer takes off enough marbles to make the size of the pile a
# power of two minus 1â€”that is, 3, 7, 15, 31, or 63. That is always a legal move, except when the
# size of the pile is currently one less than a power of two. In that case, the computer makes a
# random legal move. You will note that the computer cannot be beaten in smart mode when it has
# the first move, unless the pile size happens to be 15, 31, or 63. Of course, a human player who
# has the first turn and knows the winning strategy can win against the computer.
