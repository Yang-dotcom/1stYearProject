# Write a program, find.py, that looks for a given word in the content of a group of
# files. The program first asks for the list of files (to be inserted on a single line,
# separated by commas) and the word to search. The file names will be stored in a list
# (files), the word to search is stored in a variable.
# You must display all the lines containing the word, regardless of whether they are
# upper of lower case, each line preceded by the name of the file in which it is located.
# For example, if the word is “ring”, and list contains:
# book.txt, address.txt, homework.py
# Then the program might print:
# book.txt: There is only one Lord of the Ring, only one who can bend it to his will
# book.txt: The ring has awoken; it’s heard its masters call.
# address.txt: Kris Kringle, North Pole
# address.txt: Homer Simpson, Springfield
# homework.py: string = “text"
